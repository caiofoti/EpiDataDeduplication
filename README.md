# EpiDataDeduplication
This repository contains code developed during my internship at the State Center for Health Surveillance. The main purpose of this code is to automate the deduplication of epidemiological data on Viral Hepatitis in Rio Grande do Sul. It uses fuzzy similarity logic to ensure the correct identification of patients and proper cleaning of the database, which is essential for maintaining accurate and reliable health data records.

## Overview

This project addresses the challenge of deduplicating epidemiological data using fuzzy matching techniques. By applying string matching and similarity computations, the code effectively identifies and merges duplicate records in the dataset.

## Features

- **Automated Deduplication**: Uses advanced fuzzy matching algorithms to identify and merge duplicate records.
- **Customizable Matching Criteria**: Allows customization of matching parameters to suit specific dataset characteristics.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates reports on deduplication results, including matched and merged records.
- **Extensible**: Easily adaptable to other types of epidemiological data with minimal changes.
